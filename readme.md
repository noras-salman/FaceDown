# What is FaceDown?

Face Down | is a Facebook Cookie / Session Hijack Bash (sh) script that depends on two well know sniffers (Ettercap) and (TShark) "the Terminal based version of (Wireshark)" ,the basic job that it does is that it sniff the cookies all over the (HTTP) protocol all over the network.
This script was made as a POF (proof of concept) script for school project.

### Popularity and History:
I released this script on 23/12/2012 on http://sourceforge.net/projects/facedown/ , I'll keep the original copy there. Howerver, I don't incorage any one to download it from there beacuse SourceForge is adding some extra "Alien" files..If you know what I mean ;) . Up till now (13/10/2015) it has reached 1k + downloads.

After only a few days  of the release, [The Hacker News] made a [tweet] about my script and bloggers began to write about it. You can even find some "Script Kiddies" on youtube trying to use it , you can find an example [here] .
